                    <h4>Transport</h4>
                    <p>Most desert safari tours start from Cairo in the early morning with a private transfer. The drive to Bahariya Oasis is about 4 hours with rest stop. You will meet with the “Desert Safari Egypt” team and other travellers to have lunch at our ecolodge, “Omar Desert Camp”.  The 4X4 vehicles will be loaded up before you arrive and you will be ready to start your Egypt desert adventure.</p>
                    <p>In shorter trip, 2 days 1 night, we need to drive a lot on the road and see small parts from every sightseeing location and every stop we can only spend short time to catch the sunset in White Desert, the most popular site in western desert of Egypt. However in longer trips, you will be able to spend more time in every stop. Whichever trip you decide on, the sunset in the White Desert will be a great experience.</p>
                    <h4>Food</h4>
                    <p>We prepare and cook fresh food in all our desert safari programs at the campsite and have icebox to keep the food and drinks fresh and cold at all time. Coffee, tea and drinking water are provided throughout our desert safari trips.</p>

                    <p>In the desert, there are 3 natural springs running since ancient time. These springs are very important as they provide fresh water for shower and cooking in our long desert safari trip.</p>
                    <p>The camels also like to drink from this clean spring and it is important for the wildlife in the desert.</p>
                    <h4>How you sleep in Desert?</h4>
                    <p>We set up camp every night at different places. We have a small private tent that can fit up to 3 people each. There is also wind break for guest who love to sleep outside under the stars. Clean mattresses, warm blankets, sleeping bag, pillows are provided to the guest as well.</p>
                    <p>At the end of any program, we will return to our ecolodge, “Omar Desert Camp” in Bahariya Oasis. Upon arrival at ecolodge, guest can have shower to freshen up and enjoy lunch before heading back to Cairo.</p>
