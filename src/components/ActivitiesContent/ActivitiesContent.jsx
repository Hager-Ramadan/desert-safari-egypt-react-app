                <h1>Desert Safari Tour</h1>
                <p>In our desert safari tour, we have to explain many things to whom never travel before to the Egypt Desert. First of all, long experience of the team is very important to have a safe and comfortable desert holiday, and also to see the real desert of Egypt.</p>

                <p>The more nights you can spend is the best because the more places you can see and more adventure you can explore further into the desert. We ensure to make each trip unique for people who seeking to adventure deeper into the desert with us. If you are one who loves nature, camping does not need to be a fancy staying.</p>
                <p>The best time to travel is through October to May because our summer is very hot to do any trekking activities (very important tips). Be sure you know the difference among the desert safari programs when doing selection of which tour agency you are traveling with.</p>
